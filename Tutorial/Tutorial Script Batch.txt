tasklist /fi "ImageName eq MyApp.exe" /fo csv 2>NUL | find /I "myapp.exe">NUL
if "%ERRORLEVEL%"=="0" echo Program is running

REM /fi "" defines a filter of apps to find, in our case it's the *.exe name
REM /fo csv defines the output format, csv is required because by default the name of the executable may be truncated if it is too long and thus wouldn't be matched by find later.
REM find /I means case-insensitive matching and may be omitted


Ex:
ECHO OFF
cls
REM start "Screen" "C:\Users\NguyenTien\Desktop\Screen_Lock.exe"

tasklist /fi "ImageName eq Screen_Lock.exe" /fo csv 2>NUL | find /I "Screen_Lock.exe">NUL
if "%ERRORLEVEL%"=="1" (start "Screen" "C:\Users\NguyenTien\Desktop\Screen_Lock.exe") else (echo Program is running)
PAUSE



ECHO OFF
cls
REM start "Screen" "C:\Users\NguyenTien\Desktop\Screen_Lock.exe"
tasklist /fi "ImageName eq Screen_Lock.exe" /fo csv 2>NUL | find /I "Screen_Lock.exe">NUL
REM if "%ERRORLEVEL%"=="1" (echo Program is not running) else (echo Program is running)
REM if "%ERRORLEVEL%"=="1" start "Screen" "C:\Users\NguyenTien\Desktop\Screen_Lock.exe"
if "%ERRORLEVEL%"=="1" start "Screen" "%~dp0\Screen_Lock.exe"
